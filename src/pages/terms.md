# Terms of Use

Last Revised: September 4, 2024

## 1. Your Agreement with Korero

1.1. Your use of the Korero service (the "Service") is governed by this
agreement (the "Terms"). "Korero" means Korero, Inc. located in 1 Union Sq W,
New York, NY 10003, United States and its subsidiaries or affiliates involved
in providing the Service. The "Service" means the services Korero makes
available through this website, our API and any other software or services
offered by Korero in connection to any of those.

1.2. In order to use the Service, you must first agree to the Terms. You can
agree to the Terms by actually using the Service. You understand and agree that
Korero will treat your use of the Service as acceptance of the Terms from
that point onwards.

1.3. You may not use the Service if you are a person barred from receiving the
Service under the laws of the United States or other countries including the
country in which you are resident or from which you use the Service. You affirm
that you are over the age of 13, as the Service is not intended for children
under 13.

## 2. Your Account and Use of the Service

2.1. You must provide accurate and complete registration information any time
you register to use the Service. You are responsible for the security of your
passwords and for any use of your account. If you become aware of any
unauthorized use of your password or of your account, you agree to notify
Korero immediately.

2.2. Your use of the Service must comply with all applicable laws, regulations
and ordinances, including any laws regarding the export of data or software.

2.3.You agree not to (a) access (or attempt to access) the administrative
interface of the Service by any means other than through the interface that is
provided by Korero in connection with the Service, unless you have been
specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement with Korero, or (b)
engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the Service (or the
servers and networks which are connected to the Service).

## 3. Service Policies and Privacy

3.1. You agree to comply with the Korero Acceptable Use Policy included
available at [https://koreroapp.com/acceptable-use-policy/](/acceptable-use-policy/) (the
"Acceptable Use Policy") which is incorporated herein by this reference and
which may be updated from time to time.

3.2. The Service shall be subject to the privacy policy for the Service
available at [https://koreroapp.com/privacy/](/privacy). You
agree to the use of your data in accordance with Korero's privacy policies.

3.3. You agree that you will protect the privacy and legal rights of the users
of your application. You must provide legally adequate privacy notice and
protection for those users. If the users provide you with user names,
passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make
the users aware that the information will be available to your application and
to Korero.

## 4. Fees for Use of the Service

4.1. Subject to the Terms, the Service is provided to you without charge up to
certain limits. Usage over this limit requires your purchase of additional
resources or services. The pricing for additional resources and services can be
found [here](/pricing).

4.2. For all purchased resources and services, we will charge your credit card
on a monthly basis or at the interval indicated in the Fees and Payment
Policies, if different. Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per
month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less). Charges are exclusive of
taxes. You are responsible for paying all taxes and government charges, and all
reasonable expenses and attorneys fees Korero incurs collecting late
amounts. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you waive all claims relating
to charges unless claimed within 60 days after the charge (this does not affect
your credit card issuer rights). Charges are solely based on Korero's
measurements of your use of the Service, unless otherwise agreed to in writing.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, refunds (if any) are at the discretion
of Korero and only in the form of credit for the Service. Nothing in these
Terms obligates Korero to extend credit to any party. You acknowledge and
agree that any credit card and related billing and payment information that you
provide to Korero may be shared by Korero with companies who work on
Korero's behalf, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely
for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment to Korero and
servicing your account. Korero may also provide information in response to
valid legal process, such as subpoenas, search warrants and court orders, or to
establish or exercise its legal rights or defend against legal claims.
Korero shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of such information by
such third parties. Korero reserves the right to discontinue the provision
of the Service to you for any late payments.

4.3. Korero may change its fees and payment policies for the Service by
notifying you at least fifteen (15) days before the beginning of the billing
cycle in which such change will take effect. Changes to the fees or payment
policies will be posted in the Service FAQ or the Fees and Payment Policies (or
such other URL Korero may provide from time to time). Any outstanding
balance becomes immediately due and payable upon termination of the Terms for
any reason.

4.4. You may not develop multiple Applications to simulate or act as a single
Application or otherwise access the Service in a manner intended to avoid
incurring fees.

## 5. Content in the Service and Take Down Obligations

5.1. You understand that all information (such as data files, written text,
computer software, music, audio files or other sounds, photographs, videos or
other images) to which you may have access as part of, or through your use of,
the Service are the sole responsibility of the person from which such content
originated. All such information is referred to below as the "Content." The
term Content shall specifically exclude the web application that you create
using the Service and any source code written by you to be used with the
Service (collectively, the "Application").

pre-screen, review, refuse or remove any or all Content from the Service. You
agree to immediately take down any Content that violates the Acceptable Use

that you elect not to comply with a request from Korero to take down
certain Content, Korero reserves the right to directly take down such
Content or to disable the Application.

5.3. In the event that you become aware of any violation of the Acceptable Use
Policy by an end user of the Application, you shall immediately terminate such
end user's account on your Application. Korero reserves the right to

the Acceptable Use Policy.

5.4. You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Korero has no
responsibility to you or to any third party for) the Application or any Content
that you create, transmit or display while using the Service and for the
consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage which Korero may
suffer) by doing so.

5.5. You agree that Korero has no responsibility or liability for the
deletion or failure to store any Content and other communications maintained or
transmitted through use of the Service. You further acknowledge that you are
solely responsible for securing and backing up your Application and any
Content.

the Terms gives you a right to use any of Korero's trade names, trade
marks, service marks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand
features.

it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors) under these

property rights which subsist in that Content and the Application (whether
those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those

told that you may do so by Korero, in writing (e.g., through an open source
software license); (b) attempt to disable or circumvent any security mechanisms
used by the Service or any Application; (c) use the Service to create an
Application that performs a malicious activity, including but not limited to

(e.g., through an open source software license), you may not assign (or grant a
sub-license of) your rights to use the Service, grant a security interest in or
over your rights to use the Service, or otherwise transfer any part of your
rights to use the Service.

7.4. Open source software licenses for components of the Service released under
an open source license constitute separate written agreements. To the limited
extent that the open source software licenses expressly supersede these Terms,
the open source licenses govern your agreement with Korero for the use of
the components of the Service released under an open source license.

## 8. License from You

8.1. Korero claims no ownership or control over any Content or Application.
You retain copyright and any other rights you already hold in the Content
and/or Application, and you are responsible for protecting those rights, as
appropriate. By submitting, posting or displaying the Content on or through the
Service you give Korero a worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive
license to reproduce, adapt, modify, translate, publish, publicly perform,
publicly display and distribute such Content for the sole purpose of enabling
Korero to provide you with the Service in accordance with its privacy
policy. Furthermore, by creating an Application through use of the Service,
you give Korero a worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to

Korero to provide you with the Service in accordance with its privacy

names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names and other distinctive
brand features in presentations, marketing materials, customer lists, financial

of advertising or publicizing your use of the Service.

## 9. Modification and Termination of the Service

9.1. Korero is constantly innovating in order to provide the best possible
experience for its users. You acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of
the Service which Korero provides may change from time to time without
prior notice to you. Changes to the form and nature of the Service will be
effective with respect to all versions of the Service; examples of changes to
the form and nature of the Service include without limitation changes to fee
and payment policies, security patches, added functionality, and other
enhancements.

9.2. You may discontinue your use of the Service at any time. Korero may,
at any time, terminate your use of the Service if (A) you have breached any
provision of the Terms (or have acted in manner that clearly shows that you do
not intend to, or are unable to comply with the provisions of the Terms); or
(B) Korero is required to do so by law (for example, due to a change to the
law governing the provision of the Service); or (C) the Service relies on data
or services provided by a third party partner and the relationship with such
partner (i) has expired or been terminated or (ii) requires Korero to
change the way Korero provides the data or services through the Service; or
(D) providing the Service could create a substantial economic burden as
determined by Korero in its reasonable good faith judgment; or (E)
providing the Service could create a security risk or material technical burden
as determined by Korero in its reasonable good faith judgment.

for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any
jurisdiction.
