# Privacy Policy

Last Revised: September 4, 2024

Korero, Inc. (henceforward "Korero", "we" or "us") understands that
users of our services (“Service”) care about their privacy and how their
personal information is used and
shared. As such, we at Korero have a firm commitment to the privacy and
protection of our users.

This privacy policy applies to [koreroapp.com](https://koreroapp.com/), owned and
operated by Korero, Inc. This policy describes how we collect and use the
personal information you provide on our website. It also describes the choices
available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can
access and update this information. By visiting our website, you are consenting to
the practices described in this privacy policy.

Please also visit our [Terms of Service](/terms) which establishes the
use, disclaimers and limitations of liability governing the users of our
website. Capitalized terms that are not defined in this document have been
defined in our Terms of Service.

## Our guiding principles

We only collect information about you as reasonably necessary to provide our
Service to you. We do not share personally identifiable information except as
described in this privacy policy. We will not spam you.

## What information do we collect about you?

**User-provided information**

Korero only collects personally identifiable
information that users have voluntarily provided to us. We only ask for
information that's necessary for you to access, use and pay for our Service.
This information may include, but is not limited to, names, email addresses,
mailing addresses and credit card numbers. If you correspond with us by email,
we may retain the content of your email messages and our responses so that we
can provide you with better customer service. We also store information that
you have indirectly provided to us via your Content and Application(s).

**Log file information**

Information is automatically reported by your browser each
time you access a web page. When you use the Service, our servers automatically
record certain information that your web browser sends. These server logs may
include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (IP) address,
browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, domain names,
landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We use this
information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to
administer the website, to track averaged users' movements around the website and to
gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

## What do we use your information for?

We use your personal information only to provide you with the expected features
and functionality of the Service and respond to customer service requests. By
providing Korero your email address you consent to our using the email
address to send you critical Service notices, including any notices required by
law, in lieu of communication by postal mail.

We may also use your email address to send you other messages, including
company news, updates, related product or service information, etc. Out of
respect for your privacy, you may choose to stop receiving these messages by
following unsubscribe instructions included in these emails or you can email us
at [privacy@koreroapp.com](mailto:privacy@koreroapp.com).

We will retain your personal information only for as long as reasonably
necessary for the purposes described in this privacy policy. Please be aware
that we may also be required to retain your personal information for legal and
accounting reasons.

## When would we share your information?

Korero does not sell, trade, rent or otherwise transfer to outside parties
your personally identifiable information. This does not include trusted third
parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or
servicing you (e.g. to process your credit card transactions or provide
customer support services). These companies are authorized to use your personal
information only as necessary to provide these services to us. If we do this,
such third parties' use of your information will be bound by this privacy
policy.

We may store personal information in locations outside the direct control of
Korero (e.g. on servers at hosting providers).

We may also disclose your personal information:

* as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar
  legal process,
* when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to
  protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate
  fraud, or respond to a government request,
* if Korero, Inc. is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of
  all or a portion of its assets (you would be notified via email and/or a
  prominent notice on our web site of any change in ownership or uses of your
  personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your
  personal information),
* to any other third party with your prior consent to do so,
* if you invite another user to share your Application (e.g. by adding
  an additional account user), we will share the Application and associated
  Content with that user.

## How can you access, correct or delete your information?

If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire
our Service, you may correct, update, amend or remove it by making the change
on our member information page or by contacting us at
[privacy@koreroapp.com](mailto:privacy@koreroapp.com). We will respond to
your request to access within 30 days.

You may have the right to access the personal information that we hold about
you and to request that we correct, amend, or delete it if it is inaccurate or
processed in violation of this privacy policy. These access rights may not
apply in some cases, including where providing access is unreasonably
burdensome or expensive under the circumstances or where it would violate the
rights of someone other than the individual requesting access. If you would
like to request access to, correction, amendment, or deletion of your personal
information, you can submit a written request using the contact information
provided below. We may request specific information from you to confirm your
identity. In some circumstances we may charge a reasonable fee for access to
your information.

## What tracking technologies do we utilize?

We use cookies on our website. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a
user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We do not link the information we
store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on
our website.

We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies are
required for most of the functionality of our website and for web tools such
as our administrative application. These cookies are used to implement
application authentication, allowing us to implement secure access to your
data. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser.

A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.
You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your
Internet browser's help file. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target
the interests of our users and to improve our website. For security reasons, we do
not use persistent cookies for application authentication.

If you reject cookies, you may still use our website, but your ability to use some
key areas of our website, such as our administrative application tools, will be
disabled.

We also partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on
our website or to manage our advertising on other websites. Our ad network
partner uses cookies and web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable
information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you
targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you wish to not have this
information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out
by clicking here. Please note this does not opt you out of being served
advertising; you will continue to receive generic ads.

Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") is a coalition of over 80 online
advertising companies committed to complying with tough self-regulatory
standards that establish and reward responsible business and data management
practices. We are in compliance with NAI's Self-Regulatory Code of Conduct. To
opt out of an NAI member's behavioral advertising program, click

## How do we protect your information?

The security of your personal information is important to us. Korero uses
appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security measures to
protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, alteration,
and disclosure. On those pages
where our users can register for our service and/or log-in, we encrypt the
transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information
submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of
transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100%
secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you
have any questions about security on our web site, you can email us at
[privacy@koreroapp.com](mailto:privacy@koreroapp.com).

## What else should you know about?

authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal
information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our
sign up form. Services of this nature give you the option to sync and share
information with others within your network.

**Social Media Widgets** Certain portions of our website, such as the blog,
include Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button or Twitter
"Tweet" button. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are
visiting on our website, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function
properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party
or hosted directly on our website. Your interactions with these Features are
governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

**Personal Information of European Union Residents** To the extent that you
provide us with the personal information of residents of the European Union
that is subject to European data protection laws, we agree to comply with the
requirements of such laws. As required, Korero will enter into a data
