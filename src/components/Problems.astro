    <Card title="Endless unproductive zoom calls?">

      </p>
    </Card>

    <Card title="Messy reply-all email discussions?">
      <p>
        Having messy discussions in reply-all email threads? People get added
        or removed from the sender list creating confusion? Discussion gets
        lost in the see of other emails in your inbox? Korero keeps your
        discussions organized.
      </p>
    </Card>

    <Card title="Forgotten conversation in lost Slack tread?">
      <p>
        Was your last issue lost in some Slack tread when the conversation
        moved on? Is it hard to find the the conversation again for a follow
        up? Are you jumping around your chat history after a late reply comes
        in? With Korero, conversations are organized and where you expect them
        to be.
      </p>
    </Card>

    <!-- <Card title="Scattered meeting organization and follow-up?">
        <p>
          Is organizing and following up on meetings a scattered mess? Are you
          sending out agendas or collaboratively creating them in a common
          document, then sharing meeting notes in an email, and finally having a
          follow-up discussion in a chat room? Korero makes organizing meetings
          and follow-up discussions a breeze.
        </p>
      </Card -->

    <!-- <Card title="Does confidence win over competence?">
        <p>
          Are discussed problem solutions picked by how charismatic, aggressive,
          or senior the suggesting person is instead of meritocracy? Does the
          Joe, the awkward introverted engineer have the best solutions but
          never speak up in meetings? Asynchronous, written discussions are the
          cure.
        </p>
      </Card> -->

    <!-- <Card title="Re-visiting old discussions and running in circles?">
        <p>
          Do you find yourself re-discussing old and half forgotten issues? New
          people join the team with ideas that were discussed before but nobody
          remembers why they were dismissed? With Korero, discussions become
          documentation and all decisions have attribution.
